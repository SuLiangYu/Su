However, building storyboard which based on my observation from colleage when they using the products. I still can learn something from the this kind of informal user research. After having an image of user flow, I built personas and user journey map to make me emphaize what users might confront, then using those knowledge into design.</h3> <p class="subTitle_02">The most important thing when conducting cross-department collaboration is communication.</p> <h3>This project gave me a chance to work with different R&D teams, which includes software engineers, hardware engineers and mechanism engineers. Each function of the product needs us discuss and collaborate a lot, to make everything just right. Therefore, during the period of this project, I spent more time on communicating than conducting design, and learned about the knowledge and limitation from engineering aspect. </h3> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="footer"> <a class="mail" target="_blank" href="mailto:liaangyu@gmail.com"> <img class="mail_img" src="https://suliangyu.github.com/Su/emailicon.2bed871b.svg" alt="email icon"> </a> <a class="url" target="_blank" href="http://linkedin.com/in/liangyusu"> <img class="linkedin_img" src="https://suliangyu.github.com/Su/linkedin.b8e1e21a.svg" alt="linkedin icon"> </a> <h3>© 2022 Liangyu Su.
