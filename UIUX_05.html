            <p class="content_word"> The Girl Scouts is a place where to develop girls’ skills and positive features. We stood from caregivers’ view to rethink the whole website, used several UX research methods to find out the potential lack of information from the current website. Our group mainly focus on condensing information and adjusting structure of labels to make information which caregivers pay attention to, easily be found and reviewed.

                <p class="subTitle_05">(Interview and Survey)<br> What do caregivers value about the girl scouts?</p>
                <h3>Purpose:<br>Conducted a 10-15 minutes interview protocol and 8-10 minutes survey to find out what caregivers care about when searching information for their children. And figured out the potential information needs of caregivers from their experience sharing and viewpoints.
                    <br><br>Data:<br>4 interviews and 4 survey respondents
                    after conducting the interview and collecting information, I have formulated some insights:
                </h3>
                <h3>1. Promotion through Word of Mouth
                    <br>4/4 of the Interviewees received information about extracurricular programs such as 
                    the Girl Scouts from friends or colleagues, or their children heard from their 
                    classmates.
                    <br><br>2. Importance of Children's Voices
                    <br>3/4 of the interviewees thought children’s interest is the most important reason for 
                    them to decide if let their children join a program or not.
                    <br><br>3. Complementary Relationship between Visuals and Text 
                    <br>3/4 of the Interviewees mentioned that they like to receive information through a 
                    mixture of visuals and text. Moreover, if a piece of information can also provide links to more information that would be helpful.
                    <br><br>4. Clarity of Program's Vision
                    <br>2/4 of the interviewees value program’s vision, and they search on the website to see if the program’s vision is aligned with what they are looking for.
