            <p class="content_word"> When children get a vaccination, they often express their fear and anxiety by crying. To deal with the crying children, parents adopt different approaches, and some of these approaches indirectly impact the young mind in a
                negative way. Apart from verbal comfort, what can we do to soothe the child's uneasiness?<br><br>

                    overcome their fear. This series of design tackles a wide range of situations: from daily life to medical services at clinics. In this collection, I’ve created some roles to teach children about vaccination through storytelling. I’ve also designed some toys,
                    gadgets and a video to explain the function of vaccinations that help divert
                    children's attention. 
                    I hope that getting vaccinations will not be something children want to avoid,
                    but a fun-filled activity which they can comprehend.</h3>
